### Hi, I'm Jakl

## What I do:
- I'm developing/maintaining a few Minecraft-Bukkit plugins.
- Currently helping [MyPet](https://github.com/scomans/MyPet) to get to 1.17 ([MyMyPetFork](https://github.com/Jakllp/MyPet))
- Wow that doesn't seem like much.


Someone asked me if I had patreon.
I wouldn't know what to give as perks so I just have [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Jakllp/)
