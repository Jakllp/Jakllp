### Hi, I'm Jakl

## What I do:
- I'm developing/maintaining a few Minecraft-Bukkit plugins.
- I'm currently preparing some content for YouTube that isn't Minecraft related


Someone asked me if I had patreon.
I wouldn't know what to give as perks so I just have [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Jakllp/)

### Wanna reach me?
Join my Minecraft related [Discord](https://discord.gg/mF7GpK2vJU)  
There might be more here at some point
